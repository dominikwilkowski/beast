## How to play

The goal is to squash all beasts in each level.
You squash a beast between blocks.
When a beast touches you, you die.
You got four lives to spare.
Once all beasts are squashed you move on to the next level.
There are four levels so far.
Easily configurable if you want to extend them.
Press `q` to quit.
